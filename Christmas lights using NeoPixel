int rb;
int LL;     //OK I first used 'ln' for "led number" well 'n' can't be used, not sure why.
            // I also tried 'll' and that did not pass Verify, that's lowercase L, not sure why.
            // changing to uppercase works,
           

Adafruit_NeoPixel leds = Adafruit_NeoPixel(30, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);
            // set for 30 lights
            // PIN is set above to 6, the rest is from the stuff I downloaded

void setup() {
  leds.begin();
  leds.show(); // Initialize all pixels to 'off'
}

void loop() {
  rr = random(50); // 'rr' or 'random red' 50 seems to look the best, not to bright
  rg = random(50); // so red, blue and green values are from 0 to 50 or is it 49?
  rb = random(50);
  LL = random(1, 31); the LL is the led number from 1 to 30
  leds.setPixelColor(LL, rr, rg, rb); // set led LL to the random color
  leds.show();  // this sends the code out pin 6 to the led string - I think
  delay(50);    // you might find a longer delay to be better on a Christmas diplay

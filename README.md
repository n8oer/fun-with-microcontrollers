fun-with-microcontrollers
=========================
First and formost I must say that this is a great HOBBY for me.
I hope to add many of my projects to this site in the future.
As you can tell by my User Name I am an AMATEUR. Many projects are
HAM related and most are centered around the latest hobby parts available on the net.
When I say I am an amateur - I have a background in Mechanical Engineering,
so - all this electronics stuff is magic to me - I struggle to get most things to work.
I will try to point out items of frustration in my code.
AS I like to say: Sit back and enjoy the ride!
